# E210-02 Research Project
Jan-Jul 2025

## The project
This repo contains code that supports dynamic robotic de- and reconfiguration of building structures.
The hardware required for execution is: an ABB 6-axis robotic arm and robot controller (ABB GoFa12 1500 127cm), an eye-in-hand camera setup (Logitech Brio 100), a tool (gripper or suction tool), a PC, an ethernet cable to connect robot controller and PC, a long USB cable to connect webcam and PC.

At the core of our project is a python script that orchestrates the entire workflow: It establishes a connection to the robot and starts a scanning routine that is executed by the robot and filmed by the webcam. It initiates photogrammetric processing of the resulting video, passes the mesh to grasshopper scripts made available via rhino.compute, reads the results of static analysis, de- and reconfiguration, and lastly passes the motion sequences on to the robot.

## Using compas rrc
This repo is a fork of [compas_rrc_start](https://github.com/compas-rrc/compas_rrc_start), because our workflow relies heavily on the remote robot control framework [compas_rrc](https://github.com/compas-rrc/compas_rrc) created by researchers at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

To run this project, follow the installation guide below and additionally install TODO libraries in your python environment.

## Our contribution

### Code wise
the python oop, the python static solver, the grasshopper scripts

### Concept wise
paper might be published (submitted for review)

# Welcome to (working title robot project dynamic (dis)assembly)

Working title robot project dynamic (dis)assembly does this and that.
A python script tells cobot ABB GoFa12 1500 127cm what to do using [compas_rrc](https://github.com/compas-rrc/compas_rrc).

Soon, a camera will be mounted on the robot, it will perform a scanning routine, which then gives a collection of pictures to be photogrammetrated and meshed. A pickup order is generated and executed.

># Installation guide
>
>This guide is taken from the origin of this fork, the [compas_rrc_start repository](https://github.com/compas-rrc/compas_rrc_start).
>
>## Requirements
>
>* Windows 10 Pro 64-bit
>* CPU 2 GHz
>* Memory 8 GB
>* Disk 10 GB SSD
>* Screen 1920x1080
>
>## Installation
>
>### Anaconda
>
>* [Anaconda 3](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads): Anaconda is an open source scientific Python distribution. With this tool, we can easily create a Python environment. Install Anaconda using default options.
>
>### Docker
>* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop): Docker is a virtualization platform. We use it to run Linux containers for ROS on Windows machines. 
>* After installation, it is required to enable "Virtualization" on the BIOS of the computer. Usually this requires rebooting your computer and pressing a vendor-specific key (`F2`, `F4`, `Del` are typical options) to enter the BIOS.

<<<<<<< mirvibro-readme
>### Visual Studio
>
>* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): We recommend VS Code as the Python editor because it offers an easy-to-use interface. With this tool you can develop your process code. 
>* The following extensions are necessary:
>  * [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python): Official extension to add support for Python programming, including debugging, auto-complete, formatting, etc.
>  * [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker): Add support for Docker containers to VS Code.
>  * [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig): Add support for .editorconfig files to VS Code.
>* The following extensions are recommended:
>  * [vscode-pdf](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomoki1207.pdf): View PDF documents inside VS Code.
>  * [RAPID ABB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=abed.vscode-rapid): Syntax highligher for RAPID files in VS Code.
>
>### RobotStudio
>
>* [ABB RobotStudio](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/robotstudio): We use this tool to simulate the robot cells. Available for free on a 30-days trial version. Universities usually obtain free license packages, commercial users require paid subscriptions for robot simulation.
>* After installation, start RobotStudio and navigate to the `Add-in` tab and make sure you add the following packages:
>  * Latest RobotWare version for IRC5
>  * Latest RobotWare version for OmniCore
>
>## Start
>
>### Get started
>
>* Download or clone this repository to have all the required files on your computer
>
>### Start the robot
>
>* Unpack a `Pack&Go (.rspag)` file with a double-click. Files are in the `robotstudio-stations` folder.
>* Navigate to the `Controller` tab and open `FlexPendant`
>* Navigate to the `Simulation` tab and start the simulation (use the `Play` button in RobotStudio, not the one on the `FlexPendant`)
>
>### Start ROS driver
>
>* Make sure Docker Desktop is running (a Docker icon should appear in the Windows tray)
>* Open VS Code and open this repository folder
>* Navigate to the `docker\virtual_controller` folder
>* Compose up the `docker-compose.yml` file with a right-click
>
>### Start examples
>
>* Make sure your [conda environment has `compas_rrc` installed](https://github.com/compas-rrc/compas_rrc#installation).
>* Navigate to the `python` folder
>* Run `compas_rrc_A_welcome.py`
